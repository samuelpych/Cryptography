See the detailed requirements at https://github.com/HHS-IntroProgramming/Cryptography/blob/master/README.md
To get a character's numeric representation, find the index of that character in the string 
(use the code associations.find(char) to get the index of char's first occurrence in associations)
To get a character back from this numeric representation, get the character at that number's index 
in the string (using associations[index]).
